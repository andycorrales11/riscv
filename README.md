# RISC-V Processor Design and Verification Project

**GOAL**: Design and then verify a RISC-V processor core to improve my skills, over the span of a year, to improve my digital design and verification skills.  
**CHALLENGES**: All HDL will be written by me, on my Thinkpad X1 Carbon 2nd Gen, running Linux Mint, using Neovim. No AI will write a single line of code.  
**TOOLS**: I will use Verilator and GTKWave, two open source programs, to simulate and view waveforms.  

**SOURCES**
- *Digital Design and Computer Architecture: RISC-V Edition* by Sarah L. Harris and David Harris
- *Verilog Language and Application v29.0* Cadence Training
- *Essential SystemVerilog for UVM v1.2.5* Cadence Training
- I will keep adding more as I find them
